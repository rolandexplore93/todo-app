# Todo-App
> Todo App is a mini non-yet-fully-completed task planner application that allows users to list their tasks for the day.

> Future Improvement: I have only created basic features using reactjs. Subsequent features in progress to improve the app performance for user experience and optimal use includes; (1) Users can track and plan their daily tasks schedule for different days. (2) Countdown timer to notify users the remaining days left to their scheduled tasks. (3) Task completion feature for users to mark as completed when they complete a task. (4) More feature-rich, intuitive and advance User Interface.
